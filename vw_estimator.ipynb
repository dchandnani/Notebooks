    "# Tutorial #1: Train a Vowpal Wabbit (VW) contextual bandit model with Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **contextual bandit** setup an agent tries to learn \"a best course of action\" from (previous) observations of a context, a selected action in that context, and the corresponding obtained reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you train a VW contextual bandit model using an Azure Machine Learning (AML) Estimator on remote compute resources. You'll use the training workflow for AML in a Python Jupyter notebook. You can then use the notebook as a template to train your own contextual bandit model with your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we use a synthetic dataset of coffee preferences. Each of the samples of this dataset represents an event in which a customer of a coffee shop has been offered a type of coffee, and the customer has expressed his satisfaction with that offering. The context is the customer and other event-associated features such as time-of-day, season, weather, and so forth. There are four actions to take (four types of coffee). The goal is to learn a model of customer preferences from a number of observations of such events. \n",

Additionally, we are adding **\\-q**, short for quadratics, to the list of parameters passed to VW. This parameter tells VW to create additional features relating Customer and A_CoffeePrimary, and Customer and B_CoffeeAdditional namespaces together. The first letter of the namespaces, CA and CB in this example, is used to represent and establish these bindings (see [this tutorial](https://vowpalwabbit.org/tutorials/cb_simulation.html) for more details). We typically can achieve higher rewards by supplying this parameter. Parameter **\\-P**, short for Progress, shows frequency of logging learning metrics, in this case on every **10000** samples.\n",
